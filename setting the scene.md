# Setting the scene

- Bhagavad Gita originally appeared as a part of the epic Mahabharata. It is a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, a warrior prince. It is a dialogue between a human and God. It is a dialogue between a human and a human.
- The Mahabharata tells of events leading up to the present age of Kali Yuga, the age of quarrel and hypocrisy. It is a story of the struggle between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, for the throne of Hastinapura. The Pandavas were the sons of Pandu, and the Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas were exiled for 13 years, and during this time, they were taught the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna.
- It a great fratrical conflict between the two groups of cousins. The Kauravas were the (100)sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas were the sons of Pandu. 
- Dhritharashtra wife Gandhari was cursed to have 100 sons.
- Dhritarashtra and Pandu were brothers born in Kuru dynasty, and they were the sons of King Vichitravirya and King Shantanu respectively.
- Descendants of King Vichitravirya were called Kauravas, and descendants of King Shantanu were called Pandavas.
- The Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas were the sons of Pandu.
- Descending of King Bharata, a former ruler of the earth from whom the name of MahaBharata is derived. 
- Because Dhritarashtra the elder brother, was bron blind, he was not able to rule the kingdom. the throne was given to his younger brother Pandu. 
- When Pandu died, at an early age, the throne was given to his eldest son Yudhisthira.
- Pandu had five sons, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva - came under care of Dhritarashtra, who in effect became their guardian. 
- Thus the son of Dhritarashtra and those of Pandu grew up together as brothers in the same royal household.
- Both were trained in the art of war, and both were equally skilled in the use of weapon by the expert Drona and conunseled by the revered "grandfather" of the clan, Bhishma.
- Yet the sons of Dhritarashtra, especially Duryodhana(the eldest one), were jealous of the Pandavas, and they were determined to destroy them.
- And the blind and weak-minded Dhritarashtra wanted his sons to rule the kingdom, not those sons of Pandu(who were the rightful heirs to the throne).
