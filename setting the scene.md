# Setting the scene

- `Bhagavad Gita` originally appeared as a part of the epic `Mahabharata`. It is a conversation between `Lord Krishna and Arjuna`.
- The Mahabharata tells of events leading up to the present age of `Kali Yuga`, the age of quarrel and hypocrisy. It is a story of the struggle between two groups of cousins, the `Pandavas` and the `Kauravas`, for the throne of `Hastinapura`.
- It a great fratrical `conflict` between the `two groups of cousins`. The `Kauravas were the (100)sons of Dhritarashtra`, and the `Pandavas were the sons of Pandu`.
- `Dhritharashtra` wife `Gandhari was cursed` to have `100 sons`.

- Descendants of King Vichitravirya were called `Kauravas`, and descendants of King Shantanu were called `Pandavas`. The Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas were the sons of Pandu.
- `Dhritarashtra and Pandu were brothers born in Kuru dynasty`, and they were the sons of `King Vichitravirya` and `King Shantanu` respectively. Descending of `King Bharata`, a former `ruler of the earth` from whom the name of `MahaBharata is derived`. 
- Because Dhritarashtra the `elder brother`, was `bron blind`, he was not able to rule the `kingdom`. the throne was given to his younger brother Pandu. 

- When `Pandu died`, at an `early age`, the throne was given to his `eldest son Yudhisthira`.
- Pandu had `five sons`, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva - `came under care of Dhritarashtra`, who in effect became their guardian. 
- Thus the son of Dhritarashtra and those of Pandu grew up together as brothers in the same `royal household`.
- Both were trained in the `art of war`, and both were equally skilled in the use of `weapon by the expert Drona` and `conunseled by the revered "grandfather" of the clan, Bhishma`.

- Yet the sons of Dhritarashtra, especially `Duryodhana(the eldest one)`, were `jealous` of the Pandavas, and they were determined to `destroy them` and the `blind and weak-minded Dhritarashtra` wanted his sons to `rule the kingdom`, not those `sons of Pandu(who were the rightful heirs to the throne).`
- Thus Duryodhana and his brothers, the Kauravas, `plotted to kill the Pandavas`, and they `invited them to a game of dice` in which they `lost everything`. with Dhritarashtra's `consent`. 
- Only by the careful protection of `Uncle Vidura` and their `cousin Lord Krishna`, the Pandavas were able to `escape from many attempts on their lives`.

- `Lord Krishna` was not an ordinary `human being`, but he was `incarnated as a human being` playing the role of `prince in a contemporary dynasty`.
- He was `born in the Yadava clan`, and he was the `son of Vasudeva and Devaki`.
- In this role he was also the `nephew of Pandu's wife Kunti`, or Pritha, the `mother of the Pandavas`.
- So both as a `relative and as the eternal upholder of dharma`, Krishna favored the righteous sons of Pandu and `Protected them`.

- However the clever Duryodhana invited the Pandavas to a gambling match. Dhuryodhana and his brothers were `expert gamblers`, and they `won everything` from the Pandavas.
- Dhuryodhana and his brother took possession of `Draupadi`, the `wife of the Pandavas`, and insultily tried to strip her naked before the entire assembly of princes and kings. Krishna's divine intervention saved Draupadi from this `shameful act`, but the gambling which was rigged in favor of the Kauravas, `forced the Pandavas to go into exile for 13 years`.

- Upon returning from exile, the Pandavas rightfully claimed their `rightful place as the rulers of the kingdom`, but Duryodhana and his brothers `refused to accept them as the rightful heirs to the throne`. 
- Dutybond a prince to serve in public administration, the five Pandavas reduced their request to mere five villages, but Duryodhana and his brothers arrogantly replied that `they would not give even a small land to drive a pin`.

- Throughout all this, the Pandavas has been consistently `tolerant and forbearing`. But now the `war seemed inevitable`, and the Pandavas were `forced to fight for their rights`.
